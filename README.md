NTRU with AES for Python 2.7
====================

Description
===========
Python code showing how to utilize AES encryption with NTRU to securely encrypt messages.<br>
Will be expanded into a full end-to-end encrypted socket chat as time moves on.<br>
Code change more to utilize NTRU with 128bit keys.<br>
128bit NTRU + AES encryption example can still be found on the bottom of main.py
